Hello. My name is Dan Isaacs.

Sometimes I do things on the computer.

## What's gonna go here?

Whatever I feel like writing about, really. But it'll probably lean towards tech stuff, and probably be [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/)-heavy. (Unless I decide to start writing about cooking or Liverpool or something else altogether.)

## How is this built?

This website is built on [Astro](https://astro.build/) using the [AstroPaper](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/) blog theme, and is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
